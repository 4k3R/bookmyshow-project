# BookMyShow Project

This is a demo project, which I did as part of BookMyShow's interview process.
I was provided with multiple JSON files, and asked me to build an Android app,
which parses this data, and present the data to the user. They also provided
me with screenshots of how they implemented the same for the web.

Because of the small screen estate on mobile, my primary concern is to understand
what all data's need to be shown, and what's the best user interface, that I can develop
for the same.
